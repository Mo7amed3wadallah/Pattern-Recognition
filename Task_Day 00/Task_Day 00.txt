1. What are 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛, 𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛, 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒, 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒, and 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ?

>> - The mean: is the average in a set of data. 
       It is the most commonly used measure of central tendency. 
       It would only be used on quantitative data.

- The median: is the middle number in a set of data, when all values which comprise a given dataset have been ordered from the lowest value to the highest value. 
  It is likely the second most commonly measure of central tendency and it would also only be used on qualitative data.

- The mode: is the most frequently reported value in a set of data. It is not a commonly reported measure of central tendency.

- The variance: is an unstandardized measure of spread. 
  While it is often reported in statistical literature, the standard deviation will be more commonly encountered as it is a standardized measure of spread. 
 The standard deviation represents the average of the sum of squared deviations from the mean.

3. What is Gaussian distribution? 

>> Gaussian distribution (also known as normal distribution) is a bell-shaped curve, and it is assumed that during any measurement values will follow a normal distribution with 
     an equal number of measurements above and below the mean value. In order to understand normal distribution, 
     it is important to know the definitions of “mean,” “median,” and “mode.” The “mean” is the calculated average of all values, the “median” is the value at the center point (mid-point) of the distribution, while the “mode” is the value that was observed most frequently during the measurement.
